# TIC TAC TOE PROJECT
 The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic two-player strategy game implemented using the Qt framework with a graphical user interface. Designed with simplicity and usability in mind, the game features an intuitive layout where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid to achieve a winning combination. The application includes functionalities such as restarting the game to its initial state, maintaining a fixed window size for a consistent experience, and randomly displaying text on unclicked buttons to enhance interactivity. Built with C++ and Qt Widgets, this project provides a solid foundation for further enhancements, such as AI integration for single-player mode and a scoring system to track performance.
